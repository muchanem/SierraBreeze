In order to install the theme and add it to your decorations do the following:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/jomada/SierraBreeze
cd SierraBreeze
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
sudo make install
```
To avoid logging out, issue
``` shell
kwin_x11 --replace &
```
That is it! Your new decoration theme should appear in
*Settings &rarr; Application Style &rarr; Window Decorations*.
